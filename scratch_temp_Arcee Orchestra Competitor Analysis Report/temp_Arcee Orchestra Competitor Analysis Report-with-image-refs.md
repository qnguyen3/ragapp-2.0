Interesting quote from their recent Series A press release:

More than 65% of companies are now using generative AI but almost all of them still express significant concerns about results accuracy and data security. These challenges are holding back the full potential of LLMs for the enterprise. This is especially true for the automation of complex tasks in areas like marketing, accounting, and finance. Companies have not been able to use robotic process automation (RPA) for these use cases due to its rigid, deterministic approach, high implementation costs, brittleness, and inability to self-heal .'
