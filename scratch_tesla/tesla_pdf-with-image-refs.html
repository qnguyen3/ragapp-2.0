<p>Over two billion miles driven cumulatively on FSD (Supervised) 4 as of Q3 with more than 50% on V12</p>
<h2>S U M M A R Y</h2>
<p>We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our secondhighest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.</p>
<p>Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle 5 came down to its lowest level ever at ~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles - including more affordable models - which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our "We, Robot" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership and even public transit.</p>
<p>The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.</p>
<p>Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.</p>

<h2>V E H I C L E C A P A C I T Y</h2>
<p>Production and delivery volumes both returned to year-on-year growth in Q3. We also produced our 7-millionth vehicle October 22 nd . We continued to add to our vehicle lineup by expanding the options for new vehicle trims and paint for Model 3 and Model Y.</p>
<h2>US: California, Nevada and Texas</h2>
<p>Refreshed Model 3 ramp continued successfully in Q3 with higher total production and lower cost of goods sold quarter-over-quarter. Cybertruck production increased sequentially and achieved a positive gross margin for the first time. Preparation of the Semi factory continues and remains on track with builds scheduled to start by the end of 2025.</p>
<h2>China: Shanghai</h2>
<p>The Shanghai factory recently achieved two notable milestones: producing its 3-millionth vehicle in October and exporting its 1-millionth vehicle in September. Costs of goods sold per vehicle at the Shanghai factory improved sequentially to its lowest level ever.</p>
<h2>Europe: Berlin-Brandenburg</h2>
<p>Costs of goods sold per vehicle improved sequentially at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg. As of Q3, Model Y is the most sold vehicle of any type in 2024 in Sweden, Netherlands, Denmark and Switzerland, and was the best-selling vehicle in Europe in the month of September. Additionally, in Q3, Model Y became the best-selling EV (new vehicle sales) of all time in Norway, which now has over 60,000 units on the road.</p>

<h2>C O R E   T E C H N O L O G Y</h2>
<h2>Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware</h2>
<p>In Q3, we released the 12.5 series of FSD (Supervised) 1 with improved safety and comfort thanks to increased data and training compute, a 5x increase in parameter count, and other architectural choices that we plan to continue scaling in Q4. We released Actually Smart Summon, which enables your vehicle to autonomously drive to you in parking lots, and FSD (Supervised) to Cybertruck customers, including end-to-end neural nets for highway driving for the first time. We deployed and are training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas - where we expect to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.</p>
<h2>Vehicle and Other Software</h2>
<p>Our Summer Release included YouTube and Amazon Music as native apps. Parents can now enable Parental Controls via PIN to apply maximum speed limit, reduce acceleration to Chill, force-enable safety settings and enable curfew notifications. Other new features include Hands-Free Frunk, revamped climate controls for Model 3 and Model Y, weather forecast, air quality and improvements to in-vehicle navigation.</p>
<h2>Battery, Powertrain and Manufacturing</h2>
<p>In October, we unveiled our Cybercab and Robovan vehicles, both designed from the ground up for autonomy - without a steering wheel or pedals. Cybercab will be built on our next-generation platform which includes a new powertrain with an estimated 5.5 mi/kWh. This will be our most efficient powertrain yet. In Q3, we produced our 100-millionth 4680 cell and continued to progress our dry-cathode manufacturing lines.</p>

<h2>O T H E R   H I G H L I G H T S</h2>
<p>Our Energy and Services and Other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of Tesla. As energy storage products continue to ramp and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time.</p>
<h2>Energy Generation and Storage</h2>
<p>The Energy business achieved a record gross margin of 30.5% in Q3, a sequential increase of 596 bps, despite lower Megapack volumes. Powerwall achieved record deployments in Q3 for the second quarter in a row. Ramp of Powerwall 3 and the Lathrop Megafactory continued successfully - with Lathrop demonstrating 200 Megapack production (40 GWh annual run rate) in a single week. As of Q3, over 100,000 Powerwalls were enrolled in Virtual Power Plant programs, delivering additional financial value to owners while providing muchneeded support to the grid during periods of stress. The Shanghai Megafactory remains on track to begin shipping Megapacks in Q1 2025.</p>
<h2>Services and Other</h2>
<p>The Services and Other business achieved a record gross profit in Q3, growing over 90% year-on-year. Sequential growth in gross profit was driven mostly by higher gross profit generation from supercharging, service center margin improvement and higher gross profit generation from Parts Sales and Merchandise. Our Supercharger network continued to expand in Q3 with over 2,800 new stalls in the quarter, a 22% growth of the network YoY.</p>

<h2>O U T L O O K</h2>
<h2>Volume</h2>
<p>Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and we believe the next one will be initiated by advances in autonomy and introduction of new products, including those built on our next generation vehicle platform. Despite ongoing macroeconomic conditions, we expect to achieve slight growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024. Energy storage deployments are expected to more than double year-over-year in 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.</li>
<li>Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our</li>
</ul>
<p>hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits.</p>
<p>Product</p>
<p>Plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025. These vehicles will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.</p>
<p>This approach will result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times. This should help us fully utilize our current expected maximum capacity of close to three million vehicles, enabling more than 50% growth over 2023 production before investing in new manufacturing lines.</p>
<p>Our purpose-built Robotaxi product will continue to pursue a revolutionary 'unboxed' manufacturing strategy.</p>

<h2>WEBCAST INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Tesla will provide a live webcast of its third quarter 2024 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on October 23, 2024 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter.</p>
<h2>CERTAIN TERMS</h2>
<p>When used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units when installed and equipment sales at time of delivery. "Adjusted EBITDA" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense. "Free cash flow" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). 'Days sales outstanding' is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. 'Days payable outstanding' is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. 'Days of supply' is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter's deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period.</p>
<h2>NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Tesla's historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla's performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla's operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.</p>
